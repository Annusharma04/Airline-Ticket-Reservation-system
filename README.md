Minor Project - Booking System using Java Technology 🎫

In this project, I embarked on creating a comprehensive booking system using Java, 🚀 leveraging Java Servlets and MySQL database for backend coding, and JSP, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript templates for frontend development. The software was executed using Eclipse IDE and Tomcat server. 💻

🛠️ Technologies Used: Java Servlets, MySQL, JSP, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Eclipse IDE, Tomcat Server

The booking system is divided into two pivotal modules: User and Admin.

User Module:

👤 Users can effortlessly browse and select flights based on various filters such as date, destination, and room type.
🎟️ Implemented a user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth navigation and responsiveness, allowing users to purchase tickets and select seats with ease.
🖥️ Enhanced user experience using Bootstrap and JavaScript templates, making the process seamless and enjoyable.

Admin Module:

👩‍💼 Admins wield complete control over the system, empowering them to add, delete, and manage flights effortlessly.
💳 Integrated functionality for admins to add coupons for discounts, amplifying user engagement and satisfaction.
